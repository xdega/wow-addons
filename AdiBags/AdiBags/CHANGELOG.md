[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiBags/commits/dd415b1a2dd802d23d69511b2728fa8decf34506) 

- Added GitHub actions for packaging and releases.  
- Updated for Patch 9.1.5.  
- Updated for Patch 9.1: Chains of Domination.  
- Disembedded BugGrabber.  
    Fixes #266 & closes #472.  
- ItemButtons: Fixed support for Pawn (third-party addon).  
    Pawn doesn't define its function until after it's been loaded. Therefore, adding it as an optional dependency won't suffice.  
- ItemButtons: Added support for Pawn (third-party addon).  
    Fixes #503 & closes #504.  
- Updated for Patch 9.0.5.  
- Added an option to show the levels of caged battle pets.  
    Merges #498:  
    * Refactors UpdateButton to split item logic from the display logic. This was necessary due to multiple changes over the years that have added up and the initial assumption that only items are in your bags.  Things that aren't items include Battle Pet Cages added in Mists of Pandaria and Mythic Keystones added in Legion.

- Updated for Patch 9.0.2, the second Shadowlands pre-expansion patch.  
- Fixed item icons from overlapping within the Options UI.  
    * Fix for overlapping icons in Manual Filter configuration  
    Setting the width to 'full' instead of leaving it unspecified avoids triggering a bug in AceConfig where the height of a widget is used before the widget width is resized causing the height to be recalculated.  
    * Fix for overlapping icons in Junk Filter configuration  
    Applied width = 'full' to the ItemLists in the junk.lua AceConfig options table. This works around a bug with widgets that use flow layout and resize as elements are added/removed or as the widget width is resized.  
- Updated koKR localization.  
    The script that imports localization updates from WowAce has been broken for several years.  
- Updated links in README.  
- Updated for Patch 9.0.1, the Shadowlands pre-expansion patch.  
    Closes: #471, #475, #477, #486, #487, #488.
